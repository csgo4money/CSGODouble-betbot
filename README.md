# CSGODouble BETBOT

This script just uses the martingale method to bet on csgodouble. You can set your starting bet, mode (martingale or anti martingale) and the color you will bet on.

I can assure you that this will NOT send your coins into my account. Feel free to search for '/send' or a steam id number. 

How to use:

- 1. Login to csgodouble.com
- 2. Open up your browser console (F12)
- 3. Copy and paste the script code into the console
- 4. Choose your settings (starting bet, mode and color)
- 5. Press enter to begin
